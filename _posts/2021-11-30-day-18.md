This article is about How I spent today

To be honest, Today is a routine day for me in the office. In the morning, I woke up and went to the office. Attended our team stand-up after that I had started working on the pending feature which we are supposed to deliver last week. It got delayed due to backend issues. I synced up with the backend team and we were testing a few fixes from the backend.

After my lunch, We had a client stand-up. After that again synced up with the Backend team and tested a few scenarios. In the evening, For our office recruitment, we have set the question paper for the written test.
