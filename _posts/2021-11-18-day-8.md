An article about My college

## About My college

This article is about my college JNTUK-UCEV. Our college is located at Dwarapudi, Vizianagaram. It was established in 2007 with five Under Graduate Engineering Courses.

Our college locates on the hill at 1.5 KM from the Main road. Our college has two indoor stadiums, an outdoor stadium, two hostels for boys and girls respectively and two main blocks. We have the best view during the rainy season and winter season. Almost all the students in the college had a meal at Odissa Dhaba near the college which was famous for pulka. The saddest part is we need to walk 85 steps to reach the college from the hostel. Also, the hostel food is not so good. Hostel rooms were decent with normal facilities.

We have made a number of memories by bunking classes, Dinners, Night Outs, etc
