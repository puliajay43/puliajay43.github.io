## How today went

Today was a great day for me because of my Sister's engagement. 

In the Morning, I have waked up early in the morning around 4 A.M. With some drowsiness, I have managed to fresh up by 7 AM. Later, All the relatives have gone to the function hall but I didn't make it to the function hall due to some works at home. After all my works I have managed to reach the hall. By the time I have reached the function hall, all the events were completed. Meeting all my relatives were the real fun. I have all the fun there. Later, After all the fun We have reached home at 6 PM. 

Now, I have to sleep early and back to the office tomorrow.
