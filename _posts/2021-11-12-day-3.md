## My Favorite Trip

My favorite trip was the Trip with our class to Araku

We decided to plan a trip to Araku during our last semester. After the decision, there were a few discussions happened for budget, planning, etc. After all the discussions, Finally, we have decided on a date to start the journey from Vizianagaram. It was a two-day trip during the weekend. 

We have booked a bus for our journey. We have started on Friday mid-night around 11:30 PM. We have reached Lambasingi at 5 PM and started trekking. It was a nightmare as we have to trek for 40 minutes to watch the view. After the trek, We got to see the view and the view was worth it after the trek. We spent around 2 hrs on top of the hill. After that, we have got to visit the strawberry fields. 

We went to waterfalls after a 1-hour journey from Lambasingi. It was a bad experience because of the cool weather and cool water. Around 3 PM we have reached Araku and we had our lunch there. After that, we went to the coffee museum. Where we have a lot of fun by playing games like shooting, etc. We have also had a great coffee there. Later, We have moved to a lodge for a stay.

On the second day, We went to the park, tribal museum, Borra caves and returned back to college on Sunday Evening.
