## About Binary search

This article is about Binary search

In this problem, we need to find a given number from a sorted array.

A sorted array and element as input in which we need to find the position of the element in the array. A general approach for searching an element in an array is Linear search. When we are dealing with a large number of elements linear search takes a lot of time to find the element. So, we are using the binary search to find the element.

Search a sorted array by dividing the search interval in half. Begin with an interval covering the whole array. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half. Check until the value is found or the interval is empty.

The complexity of the binary search is O(log n)
