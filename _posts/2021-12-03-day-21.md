## About feedback of this program

This article is about the feedback of this program

Before this 21 Day writing challenge program writing an email or a blog was quite painful for me because of the arrangement of sentences and I used to check twice or thrice to correct the sentences for even minimal blogs. But for continuous writing, I got the fluency in writing the minimal things. Also from your feedbacks and resources, I have to learn a lot of things for better writing. Also, I need to work on tenses and practice more on writing.
