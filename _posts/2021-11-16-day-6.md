An article about My Favourite Cricketer

## My Favourite Cricketer

My favorite cricketer is Suresh Raina. He was a retired Indian cricketer who had a great career from 2005 to 2020. He was a left-hand batsman, occasional off-spin bowler, and one of the greatest fielders in the world.

During the 2011 ICC World cup, India needs to chase a total of 261 against Australia. Almost 5 wickets were down. Need to chase around 50 runs in 10 overs. He walked into the ground after Dhoni's wicket and played a responsible innings with Yuvaraj Singh. Also, He was the only batsman to hit a six in that innings. From that match, I became a fan of Suresh Raina.

Later, I watched all the matches he played. When I got access to Youtube on those days, then I used to watch the previous innings he played. I was also a fan of the CSK franchise in IPL because of him. 

I want to meet him and want to experience the fanboy moment.
