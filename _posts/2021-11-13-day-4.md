## How to write well

We will be writing an email, article, message, etc in our daily life. But, we have to write that others can understand our thoughts through our writing. So, writing is the key to knowing our thoughts.

Here are some key points to improve our writing skills:

1. By reading: Through reading the books/articles, we can know how the author forms the sentences, usage of words, vocabulary, etc. By exploring different books/articles from different authors we can experience the change in style and pick the best style.

2. By learning new words: Exploring various books to know new words for delivering the long word into a small word. The selection of words implies the standard of writing skill. 

3. By making writing a daily habit: Making a daily habit of writing motivates us to write more blogs/articles which improves perfection. 

4. By adapting the style: We need to write based on the situation for email, article, etc. Sometimes, writing an email as a long article doesn't make any sense.

5. By checking the mistakes: Checking the mistakes and not repeating them in the future is the key to better writing.
