About previously worked project

## About previously worked project

This is an article about the project that I had worked on last year.

The idea of the project is to provide a platform for music students to learn music. It was like Udemy for music. It is a live session where one teacher will be on a video call, the students will interact using live chat.

Music teachers register for teacher roles. Users for the teacher role need some verification. The user will be a teacher if he passes the verification. Users provide their achievements and recordings of their previous concerts, etc. 

There is no verification process for the student. One can register, pay, and attend the class. There are many types of classes like Workshop, Master class, etc.
