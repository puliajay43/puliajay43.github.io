## Leave Mail


Dear Mark,

I am writing this letter to inform you that I need one week leave from 22nd November 2021 to 26th November 2021. My sister's marriage is on 24th November in our village. There are a few marriage-related works that I need to attend on pre and post marriage.

I will be back on 29th November and I have finished the pending tickets that I am currently working on. In case of emergency, You can reach me through mobile.

Thanks in advance for considering my leave.

Thanking you

Yours truly,
P. Ajay
