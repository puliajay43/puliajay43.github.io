How companies should treat their employees

## How companies should treat their employees

This article is about How companies should treat their employees.

As of now, I was working in one company that to a start-up company. Employees are flexible to express their views on the development of the project in a start-up. Most corporate companies don't have this flexibility due to a large number of employees. Employees should have flexibility on shifting the project if they are not interested anymore. Employees should have the option of proposing new technology, frameworks, etc.
